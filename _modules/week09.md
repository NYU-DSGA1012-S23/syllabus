### Meaning, Knowledge, and Ontology

When we talk about the "meaning" of a word or expression, we are assuming that the expression says something about
objects in the real world. Using Amazon Alexa as an example, we learn how NLU systems parse natural language utterances
into logical expressions, which are interpreted according to an _ontology_ that models the universe of objects.
