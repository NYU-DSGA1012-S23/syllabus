### What Is Understanding?

We have now learned many ways to teach a model about "meaning." But do models truly _understand_ natural language? 
We conclude the course with a discussion of the notion of "understanding," and highlight the limitations of current 
techniques.

Topics
: Clever Hans models, adversarial test sets, dataset artifacts, the imitation game (Turing test), the Chinese room 
thought experiment, the octopus test
