### The Building Blocks of Meaning

Meaning in natural language has an important property: it is _compositional_, meaning that the meaning of a complex 
expression is a combination of the meanings of its parts. In this lecture we will learn about how individual words 
combine with one another to form complex expressions with complex meanings.

Topics
: Compositional semantics, natural language syntax, lambda calculus, predicate logic, logical form
