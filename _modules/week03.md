### Basic Techniques 1: Deep Learning

We will learn how to define, train, and test a deep neural network model using the backpropagation and stochastic
gradient descent algorithms. We will introduce common neural network architectures in NLU such as the multi-layer
perceptron, the recurrent neural network, and the Transformer.

Topics
: Neural networks, backpropagation, stochastic gradient descent, LSTMs, Transformers
