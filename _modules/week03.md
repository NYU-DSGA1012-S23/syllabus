### Basic Techniques 1: Deep Learning

We will learn how to define, train, and test a deep neural network model using the backpropagation and stochastic
gradient descent algorithms. We will introduce common neural network architectures in NLU such as the multi-layer
perceptron, the recurrent neural network, and the Transformer.

Topics
: Neural architectures (MLP, RNN, LSTM, Transformer), automatic differentiation, the PyTorch software package, 
hyperparameter tuning

Deadlines
: **HW 1 Due**{: .label .label-red }
: **EC 1 Due**{: .label .label-green }
