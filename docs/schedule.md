# Schedule and Readings

The course schedule may be subject to change. All deadlines are on Wednesday at 9:30 AM unless stated otherwise.

The textbooks for this course are:
* [_Dive into Deep Learning_](https://d2l.ai/index.html) by Aston Zhang, Zachary C. Lipton, Mu Li, and Alexander J.
Smola (Zhang et al., 2021)
* [_Linguistic Fundamentals for Natural Language Processing II_](https://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00935ED1V02Y201907HLT043)
by Emily M. Bender and Alex Lascarides (Bender and Lascarides, 2019)

These textbooks are primarily for reference; we will not be "following" them in any sense. You will also be assigned
original research papers and notes by Sophie for reading.
