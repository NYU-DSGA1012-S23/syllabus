Course notes by Sophie

These textbooks are primarily for reference; we will not be "following" them in any sense. Additionally, you will also
be assigned original research papers and notes by Sophie for reading. All readings are available online free of charge.
Some of them may require you to be on campus wi-fi or VPN or to be logged into your
[NYU Drive](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/communication-and-collaboration/document-collaboration-and-sharing/nyu-drive.html)
account.
