# Schedule and Readings

The course schedule may be subject to change. All deadlines are on Wednesday at 9:30 AM unless stated otherwise.

The textbooks for this course are:
* [_Dive into Deep Learning_](https://d2l.ai/index.html) by Aston Zhang, Zachary C. Lipton, Mu Li, and Alexander J.
Smola (Zhang et al., 2021)
* [_Linguistic Fundamentals for Natural Language Processing II_](https://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00935ED1V02Y201907HLT043)
by Emily M. Bender and Alex Lascarides (Bender and Lascarides, 2019)

These textbooks are primarily for reference; we will not be "following" them in any sense. Additionally, you will also
be assigned original research papers and notes by Sophie for reading. All readings are available online free of charge.
Some of them may require you to be on campus wi-fi or VPN or to be logged into your
[NYU Drive](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/communication-and-collaboration/document-collaboration-and-sharing/nyu-drive.html)
account.
