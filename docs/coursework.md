# Coursework and Grading

Throughout this course, you will complete:
* 3 homework assignments
* a number of reading quizzes
* a final project.

The composition of your final grade is as follows.

| Item                 | Percentage |
|----------------------|------------|
| Participation        | 8%         |
| Reading Quizzes      | 12%        |
| Homework Assignments | 30%        |
| Project              | 50%        |
| **Total**            | **100%**   |

## Submissions and Deadlines

Unless otherwise stated, all submission deadlines are on **Wednesdays at 9:30 AM**.[^1] Each coursework item will be 
released on [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/244031), and submissions and grading will take place 
on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) (which you can access through Brightspace). Materials and 
further instructions for coursework items may occasionally be released on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/NYU-DSGA1012-S23); please see Brightspace for details specific to each assignment.

#### Late Submissions
Late submissions may be accepted for some coursework items. Please consult the instructions for each coursework item 
for specific guidelines. Late work will be penalized by 1 percentage point of the item's total grade for each hour 
(full or partial) that the work is late. However, you will have grace period of 168 hours over the entire semester 
during which you can submit late work without penalty. You do not have to ask permission to use the grace period; it 
will be calculated at the end of the semester so as to optimize your final grade.[^2]

#### Extensions
Extensions for documented emergencies may be granted the discretion of the instructor. **Do not contact the TAs for extension requests.**

## Project

The main requirement of this course is to produce an original research project on natural language understanding (NLU) 
and/or computational semantics. As with an actual research project in this field, the final product of your project 
will consist of an [ACL-style short paper](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html) and an in-class oral 
presentation of your findings. The length limit of both your paper (4 pages maximimum) and your presentation (TBD) 
will be very short, but the expectations for clarity and thoroughness will be high.

To guide you through the process of doing research in NLU, your project will be divided into five components, and 
you will work on it in groups of three or four. 

| Item                  | Due Date              | % of Project Grade | % of Final Grade | 
|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Project Mini-Proposal | March 1               | 10%                | 5%               |
| Project Proposal      | March 29              | 20%                | 10%              |
| Final Paper Draft     | April 19              | 20%                | 10%              |
| Final Paper           | May 12 (12:00 PM)     | 40%                | 20%              |
| In-Class Presentation | May 12 (8:00â€“9:50 AM) | 10%                | 5%               |
| **Total**             |                       | **100%**           | **50%**          |

[^1]: If no time is give for a particular deadline, please assume that it is 9:30 AM.

[^2]: For instance, if you submit one homework assignment exactly 3 days late, the project mini-proposal exactly 6 days 
late, and all other coursework items on time, then your total late penalty will be 48 percentage points of your project 
mini-proposal 
grade (2.4 percentage points of your final grade).
