# Course Policies

## Collaboration

Collaboration is strongly encouraged, both in this course and in the profession of NLP. Please make sure you adhere to the following guidelines.

* **Homework Assignments:** You may discuss the homework assignments with anyone at any time, but you must ultimately 
complete and write up the assigned work for yourself.
* **Reading Quizzes:** You are strongly encouraged to discuss the readings with your peers before the reading quizzes 
  open, but you may not discuss the readings or quiz questions with anyone while the quizzes are open.
* **Project:** Projects should be completed in groups of three or four, which should be formed by the time the full 
  proposal is submitted. 

## Deadlines

Homework assignments, reading quizzes, and the project are due by 11:59 PM on the specified due date.

* **Late Work:** A penalty of 1 percentage point will be applied for each hour (full or partial) that the work is late, 
rounded to the nearest hour.
* **Extensions:** Extensions for documented emergencies may be granted at the discretion of the instructor.
