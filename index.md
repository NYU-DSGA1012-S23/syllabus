# Natural Language Understanding and Computational Semantics

**DS-GA 1012/LING-GA 1012, Spring 2023**<br />
**New York University**

This is an advanced master's level course in natural language processing, with focus on the representation of 
meaning at various linguistic levels. Students will learn basic techniques in deep learning, transfer learning, and 
in-context adaptation while being introduced to natural language understanding tasks such as text classification, 
syntatic and semantic parsing, and question answering. The course will culminate in an original research project 
completed by the student in collaboration with two to three classmates.

## Prerequisites

The recommended prerequisite for this course is _Natural Language Processing with Representation Learning_ (DS-GA 
1011). You will still be able to register for the course if you have not taken DS-GA 1011, but please be aware that 
this is an advanced course. Students are expected to have seen most of the following concepts before.
* **Calculus and Linear Algebra:** Partial derivatives, gradients, vectors, matrices, matrix multiplication, vector 
  spaces
* **Probability and Statistics:** Probability distributions, conditional probabilities, Bayes's theorem, linear 
  regression
* **Machine Learning and Data Science:** Classification, regression, features (discrete vs. continuous), optimization,
  train/dev/test
* **Neural Networks and Deep Learning:** Feedforward networks, the backpropagation algorithm, gradient descent
* **Programming in Python:** Basic Python syntax, Jupyter notebooks, Python modules, object-oriented programming, 
  code optimization
* **Linguistics:** Morphology, phrase structure, syntax trees, compositional semantics
* **Natural Language Processing:** Tokenization, vector semantics, language modeling
